                <p>Waterbending,is the hydrokinetic ability to control water in all of its various forms. Water is the element of change. This type of bending is used by the people of the Water Tribe, who are divided into the Southern, Northern, and lesser-known Foggy Swamp tribes. The moon is the source of power in waterbending, and the original waterbenders learned to bend by observing how the moon pushed and pulled the tides.</p>

                <img src="images/earth-bending.gif" alt="a gif of earth bending">
                <p>Earthbending, is the geokinetic ability to manipulate earth and rock in all their various forms, prevalent in the Earth Kingdom and the United Republic.

                <p>Firebending, is the pyrokinetic ability to control and produce fire. It is unique among the bending arts, as it is the only one in which the performer can generate the element.
